  summary:
    " journey 5 years ago and worked on real-life project Founder My Own Business. One of my notable recent works was a countdown page for the Grand Egyptian Museum, delivered urgently during th\e Eid holiday, with full attention to detail and tight deadlines.Recently, I built my latest project using React.js + Vite, which reflects my current skills. Earlier projects were from the beginning of my journey, but they were essential foundations. Iâ€™m also passionate about entrepreneurship. Iâ€™ve previously launched my own business and now I'm back to the tech field â€” learning, growing, and working toward launching my own software company to power future projects. I value commitment, precision, and results â€” and I always strive to exceed expectations.",
